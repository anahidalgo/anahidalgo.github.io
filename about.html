							<p>Who am I?</p>

							<p>Hello! I'm Ana. I was born in the city of Rio de Janeiro. My family
								comes from Peru, but I am the first Brazilian in the family! Thanks to my origins,
								I learned to speak Spanish at the same time that I learned to speak Portuguese.</p>
								
							<p>I have a degree in Architecture from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), and I carry with
								me the strong social awareness that I learned in the course. Planning and designing environments
								is an activity that I do with great pleasure, but drawing has always been my greatest passion.</p>
							
							<p>Since I was a child I like to draw, and when I became an adult, I turned my passion
								into my profession. Architecture gives me a way to represent the world through
								drawing. And, uniting with civil construction, I tried to help people with my work.</p>
							<p>However, the desire to represent realities never left me, so I continued
								my studies in illustration. With the awareness of the world that I learned
								to have in the Architecture course, I started to apply them in my drawings.</p>
							<p>I work with patterns, using my dear paper and pencil, and I also work with the digital world
								and its trends. With that, I also acquired experience in the editorial and advertising line.</p>
							<p>Today I share my drawing board of plants, cuts and facades, with stories of stories, dreams
								and people. I seek to unite the two experiences, from reality to fantasy, to satisfy customers,
								always with professionalism and great affection.</p>
